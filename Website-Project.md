# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to have a website to hold all of my tech/cloud portfolio projects.
Its important that I utilized a Cloud Service Provider (CSPs) solution. 

# Technology Stack

- Draw.io (Diagramming)
- Github (Repo) and GitHub.dev (Static IDE)
- Gitpod.io (IDE)
- HTTP Server (Web Server) https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- ChatGPT (Generating out HTML and CSS)



# Project Planning

## Utilize ChatGPT to rapidly build HTML and CSS 

## Hypothesis 

I think I can utilize ChatGPT or a similar service to quickly design our website. 

- you need to feed the design of the page one at a time, but it does produce results

#### prompts used

```txt
 I am building a portfolio website to showcase my techonology skills. I would like to create HTML markup and CSS for the designs provides. Please use flexbox and dont use absolutes or fixed values. I will provide you an image, and then I only wan the html back first. After I provided you all of my images, I will then ask for the css which will be applied to all pages. 
```
##### Results
The first attempt did not produce adequate results.
- the layout did not look correct

On further investigation I noticed this as well 
- the markup could have used more tags and less verbose
- the css looked adequate, but there must be clear mistakes with the CSS 




- Maybe we need to provide it more text and then the layout will work correctly
- Maybe we need to invest more time into our layout page
- Maybe we need to investigate the markup and css provide it bette instructions
- Maybe ChatGPT cannot adequately produce basic websites.

# Obstacles and Results

## Draw.io 

I decided to implement our architectual diagrams in Draw.io due to its free use. It has all architecual icons for all major cloud service proviers. Software was difficult to utilized efficiently. For better results I would use Lucid Charts, It will greatly be more time efficient.
