# Obstacles and Results

## Draw.io 

I decided to implement our architectual diagrams in Draw.io due to its free use. It has all architecual icons for all major cloud service proviers. Software was difficult to utilized efficiently. For better results I would use Lucid Charts, It will greatly be more time efficient.
